# FDM: Force Density Method

Force Density Method for determining equilibrium geometry of tensile nets. Revised code from previous editions to be more portable and query-able. Inspired by [jax_fdm](https://github.com/arpastrana/jax_fdm) by Rafael Pastrana.

Based on "Force Density Method: Design of a timber shell: by Klaus Linkwitz.

Will eventually be integrated into [Asap.jl](https://github.com/keithjlee/Asap).
